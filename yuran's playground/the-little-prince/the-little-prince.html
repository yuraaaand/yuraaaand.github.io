      <h1>the little prince.</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p> This is a text image sketched by p5.js. I played around with an excerpt of 
          <b><i>The Little Prince</i></b> by <b><i>Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry</i></b>. 
          The number of appearances in the text is calculated for each charater and determines its appearance. 
          Ultimately, the letters are not even needed any more. Move your mouse (or finger) and explore my sketch interactively :).

      <p class="small"> Hint: try pressing [1], [2], [3], [4] and [s].</p>
